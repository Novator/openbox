This is improved Openbox with big (enlarged) close button.
Also added two example themes: "Onyx-Retro" and "Retro 6 (XP Novator)".

Now you can increase the close button with editing a theme setup file, for example:

  /usr/share/themes/Onyx-Retro/openbox-3/themerc

and adding parameter "close.button.percent", example value:

  close.button.percent: 150

means 150% from base button size. A title of the window will look like this:

  [_][u][ x ]



HOW TO COMPILE AND USE

1. Download source using git:

  git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Novator/openbox

2. Enter to "openbox" directory and execute four commands:

  ./bootstrap
  ./configure --prefix=/usr
  make
  make install (with root user)

3. You need to restart openbox to gain effect (with usual user):

  openbox --restart

4. Use "obconf" utility to choose a big button theme.
If you changed your current theme it's need to reswitch the theme to another
and switch it back.
